# Building/modifying the application
If you want to modify the code you will need to install to install Eclipse on your computer.

# Running the application
When running on Windows 32 or 64 bit make sure that you install the correct usb serial library. Same goes for Mac or Linux
You can run it from the jar file on all platform. For Windows I have compiled some executable.
